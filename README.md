# TheSimonGame_JQuery
Learning jQuery - a boss level exercise from the Udemy fullstack course by Dr. Angela Yu

The Simon game is a simple memory game. Since I watched the Udemy videos but didn't really do more, since completing the dice game and drum kit, I feel a little more confident to dig deeping into JS and want to add jQuery to my tech stack.

Just another note, the base files are provided by the course.
